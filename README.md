# ðŸ”Œ Plug Router

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a submodule of the [Plug monorepo](https://github.com/nftchance/plug) that contains all the pieces of the Plug toolkit.

## Dependencies

To run `@nftchance/plug-router` it is necessary to install the following dependencies first:

```ml
â”œâ”€ docker â€” "Pipeline to run containerized code processes."
â””â”€ pnpm â€” "Efficient package manager for Node modules."
```

## Developer Configuration

`nftchance/plug-router` uses a [default-loaded configuration file](/src/lib/utils/env.ts) that is validated with the use of `zod`. All values can be overriden by setting values for each of the environment variables in your `.env` file.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended that you use Docker. If you have a Docker process running, you do not even need to manually create a new container or deal with the complexities. There is [a built-in script that will create a new database and start the container for you](/src/lib/scripts/db.ts).

You can override the default configuration of any value by setting it in your `.env` file. Due to the validate nature of the configuration, if you ever have an issue with your configuration, you will automatically receive a runtime error that is bubbled up when you try to start the application.

The full list of configuration options is as follows:

```ml
â”œâ”€ VERSION â€” "The version of the router."
â”œâ”€ DATABASE_URL â€” "The URL the database is running on."
â”œâ”€ PORT â€” "The port of the router API."
â”œâ”€ API_URL â€” "The URL of the router API."
â”œâ”€ RATE_LIMIT_ALLOW_LIST â€” "The list of IP addresses that bypass rate limiting."
â”œâ”€ RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS â€” "The window in milliseconds that rate limiting is applied to."
â”œâ”€ RATE_LIMIT â€” "The number of requests allowed in the rate limiting window."
â”œâ”€ RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGE â€” "The message that is returned when rate limiting is exceeded."
â”œâ”€ SIMULATOR_URL â€” "The URL of the simulator API that is used to simulate transactions."
â”œâ”€ SIMULATOR_API_KEY â€” "The API key of the simulation API."
â”œâ”€ CONTAINER_NAME â€” "The Docker container name hosting the PostgreSQL database."
â”œâ”€ DATABASE_NAME â€” "The name of the PostgreSQL database."
â”œâ”€ DATABASE_PORT â€” "The port of the PostgreSQL database."
â””â”€ DATABASE_PASSWORD â€” "The password of the PostgreSQL database."
```
